# My Learning Plan For Next 90 Days.
**
1. DevOps is a culture of continuous learning, finding new things everyday, troubleshoot and solve the problems and collaborate with development and operation team 
and basically automate the code and deploy the code with reliability, quick and in secure way.**
2. I am learning devops and cloud because I want to switch from development background to Devops and Cloud and Get The Job in This Field.
3. If I have to learn only few things daily but consistently and If I have to get job faster in cloud then daily hands-on practice is essential and there is no other option to get the job in this.


 Currently I am working as a flutter developer in a private limited company.
